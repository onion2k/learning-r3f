# Welcome to react-three-fiber By Example

This is a collection of examples that I've built during the course of learning how to use the react-three-fiber library (and associated libraries).

- Basics

  The absolute basics. The minimum necessary to get something on a screen.
- Geometries

  3D objects are made from geometries and materials. These are examples of geometry in r3f.
- Hooks

  r3f provides some React hooks that are useful in putting 3D scenes on a web page.
- Cameras

  Cameras control what gets rendered. This section also includes moving the camera with controls.
- Lighting

  Lighting a scene can be complicated. These are examples of some ways to do it.
- Materials

  Materials control how 3D objects are rendered. They can be basic colors with shading, texture maps, or GLSL shaders.
- Models

  Loading 3D models that have been created in other applications.
- Physics

  Controlling how objects in a scene move around, mostly with the useCannon hook.
- Effects

  r3f can apply post-processing screenspace effects using Three's effectComposer.
- Shaders

  Somewhat more complex examples
- Other

  Everything that doesn't fit in any of the other categories.
